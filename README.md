# deep_learning

A collection of deep learning projects I have created during my deep learning class at UC Berkeley. TL_DCRNN describes the method to transfer graph-related learnings from one dataset to another. We implemented this to help model traffic patterns in the Bay Area based on learnings from the greater LA area.
